# CIS427 Project One
https://github.com/mjaratli/CIS427ProjectOne

### How to build and run the program
First, open the project in an IDE. I used IntelliJ IDEA Edu.
To run the program, first build the 
server class and then build the client class.
This is because the server listens for 
a connection, not the client. After doing that, you 
can start using the commands : login, solve, 
list, logout, and shutdown.

### The five commands
1. Login
- Allows the user to login
- The user must log in with a proper password to use 
the commands solve, list, and logout
2. Solve
- Use the solve command to get information on a circle, square, or rectangle
- Format 1: solve -c #
- Format 2: solve -r #
- Format 3: solve -r # #
3. List
- List gives you all of the results of the solve commands that you have done
- If you are the root user, list -all gives you all users results from 
previous solve command calls
4. Logout
- Logout to login with a different user, there is no need to reconnect
5. Shutdown
- Shutdown terminates the programs and closes all sockets

## Problems or bugs
There are no known problems or bugs in the program.
